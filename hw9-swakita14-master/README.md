## The purpose of this assignment is to:
 1. Learn the motivations behind the benefits of an architecture that supports live, rolling updates
 2. Gain hands-on experience executing a live, rolling update with a microservice that you designed 
 
## Set up
In order to build the same environement setup that I was working in please follow the steps:

For version 1: 
```bash
cd hw8-swakita14.git
git checkout v1.1

```

For version 2: 
```bash
cd hw8-swakita14.git
git checkout v2.0

```

2. Clone [my hw9 repository](https://github.com/wou-cs/hw9-swakita14.git)
3. Get in the pipenv shell for all three directories:
```bash
